        I live in Davao City, Philippines and I am very passionate about PHP/Laravel, I used this in every project since 2013.
        I'm also a python hobbyist during my free time I learn Python and solving programming problems.

        I got inspired to start blogging so that I could reach out to those other local developer in my area who wanted to have
        companion in their journey to learning and mastering Laravel & Python.

        I started as a Computer Programmer which specializes in doing Desktop application using Visual Basic to automate task in
        the office. I also have a little background on Java Swing Framework where I tried to create POS system. I then have a job
        as a Junior Developer in a company here Davao, at first I worked as an Python Developer customizing OpenERP which is now Odoo.
        Then I moved to .Net Framework to learn the company Platform for Financial Software Developement and started to learn PHP
        scripting for web crawling and data mining.
